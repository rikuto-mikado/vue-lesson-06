# Vue Lesson 06 - Events and Two-Way Data Binding

## What I Learned
- Event handling with v-on:click directive
- Event modifiers (.right, .prevent, .enter) for specific event - behaviors
- v-model as shorthand combining v-bind:value and v-on:input for  two-way data binding
- v-model can be combined with other event listeners like v-on:keyup.enter
- $event special keyword to pass event object to methods

## Challenges
- Understanding v-model is syntactic sugar but can still work with additional event listeners
- Remembering that removing event listeners breaks dependent functionality
